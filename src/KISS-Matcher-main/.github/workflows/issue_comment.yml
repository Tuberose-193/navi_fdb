Could you provide more details such as:\n\n- A clear description of the problem\n- Steps to reproduce\n- Expected vs. actual behavior\n- **Important** The result of visualizing the current situation/problems \n- Your environment (OS, software version, etc.)\n\nThis will help us investigate the issue effectively. Thanks! ðŸš€"
